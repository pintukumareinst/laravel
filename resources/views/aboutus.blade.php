        <h5 style="color: black;">Educators First, Developers Second</h5>
        <p>Education is about more than conveying information - it's about understanding how people think, learn, and truly grasp the material at hand. We understand that every new concept requires a unique approach, and that even the most advanced subject-matter experts must also be well-trained educators to produce great results. That's why all of our Lead Instructors are experienced educators as well as professional developers.</p>
